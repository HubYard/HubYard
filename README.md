!!! I've decided to temporarily abandon support of this project, I will still monitor pull requests.

# HubYard
### What is HubYard?

HubYard is a modern and sleek social media management platform. It assists you in viewing, connecting, and posting to an audience from a vareity of networks. The service can also be used to monitor and enjoy tons of free platforms.

### Contributing

HubYard is built ontop of Node.js and MongoDB. The front end is rendered in a tonne of Jade. If you have a suggestion on a new front-end renderer I'm all ears.

Both the development and production environment are initialized the same way, please read the section below onto how to create one.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact us! Feel free to email us at <a href='mailto:contact@hubyard.com'>contact@hubyard.com</a>

### Setting up an Environment
<b>Step 1</b>
Install MongoDB onto a local or remote server and recieve a connection string

<b>Step 2</b>
Do the following (This assumes you already have node.js & npm installed.)

```
git clone git@github.com:HubYard/HubYard.git hubyard
cd hubyard
npm install -d
```

<b>Step 3</b>
Navigate to /env and edit the production keys to your API keys. 

(URL_Host) is your host aka http://localhost:4002

<b>Step 4</b>
Run and Enjoy (runs on localhost:4002)
```
node app.js
```

### FYI: Not all of HubYard's code is Open Source
Why? Because it's sadly (not our) proprietary software. Things such as Google Analytics, Olark, and DataStack integrations are removed from the github release. This means that source releases may take longer to appear than when it updates on the website. Don't fret though. You don't need that software to be awesome and run this platform!
